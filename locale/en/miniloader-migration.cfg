mmm-dummy-description=This is a non-operational dummy loader marking the loacation of a former Miniloader.  This old Miniloader needs to be migrated or removed.  Use the console command /mdrn-migrations for more detail.
mmm-warning-notice=*** BACKUP ***  BACKUP *** BACKUP ***\n\nMigrating Miniloaders from the miniloader mod is experimental, but I think I have it mostly working well enough to serve your purposes.\n\nPlease make sure you have a backup of your game save before you save this migrated save.  There is no path back or undo!\n\nIf you notice loaders from a belt set that did not migrate, please let me know and I will try to incorporate them.\n\nAfter your migration is complete, please remove the Miniloader migration mod.\n\n*Note: All Miniloader and Filter Miniloader items in inventories and containers are gone.  This is a one time loss - sorry.  Assemblers creating miniloaders will now be idle and need to manually be configured with a new recipe.\n\n-Kryojenik\n\n*** BACKUP *** BACKUP *** BACKUP ***
mmm-not-migrated-notice=The following loaders were not migrated.  If you save now and KEEP the Miniloader migration mod enabled this list will be maintained.\n\nThe only way to remove these dummy / non-functional loader is via this window or by disabling the Miniloader migration mod.\n\nYou can reopen this list with the command /mdrn-migrations.\n\nPlease report any belt packs that result in miniloaders not migrating and I may be able to add support.\n\n-Kryojenik
mmm-filter-notice=The following lodaers had complex, split lane configuraitons that will not be supported in this implementation.
