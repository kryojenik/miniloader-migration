Version: 0.8.1
Date: 2024-12-16
  Info:
    - Hopefully everyone likes how this mod works and the direction it is going.
      I've added a specific Stack loader entity that will operate at your fastest tier belt speed.
      It will be locked behind Fulgora and require Stack inserters in the recipe.  By enabling this, all
      other loaders will revert to not Stack.  You can adjust these behaviors with the mod settings.
      I'm sure with the recent changes I broke something for someone.  Please let me know in the discussions and I'll fix it as soon as I can.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix crash possible crash in multiplayer due to missing nil check (#17)
    - Turbo loader wasn't requiring to be built on Vulcanus
    - Fixed technology icons incorrectly tinting the loader frame
  Features:
    - Setting added when AAI-Industry is detected which allows user to choose to use AAI-Industry recipe or mod recipe
    - Separate stack Loader entities option added (Thanks jcclark1414)
      - Makes a single Stack Loader entity that requires stack inserters.  This will be the default going forward
      - You are still able to keep the prior behavior where all loader can stack once the research is completed
      - The stack loader will be able to fill your fastest belt
